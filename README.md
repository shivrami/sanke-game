Excited to Share My First Project: Snake Game!
I am thrilled to present my first project, a classic Snake game, developed using React. This project was a great learning experience, and I am excited to share it with the community. Check it out on GitHub!

üêç Snake Game
This project is a digital version of the classic Snake game. Here are some of its key features:

Interactive Gameplay: Control the snake using arrow keys to eat food and grow longer. Avoid hitting the walls or the snake‚Äôs own body!
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of your score, which increases as the snake eats more food.
High Score: The highest score is saved and displayed, challenging you to beat your previous records.
Responsive Design: The game is designed to work seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes.
üöÄ Features
React: Built with React to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.
State Management: Utilizes React‚Äôs state management to handle the game logic, including the snake‚Äôs movement and collision detection.
CSS Flexbox/Grid: The game board is designed using CSS Flexbox/Grid for a responsive and adaptable layout.
Local Storage: High score is saved using local storage, so you can keep track of your best game even after refreshing the page.
üìÇ GitHub Repository
You can view the source code and try out the game by visiting the GitHub repository:

Feel free to check it out, play the game, and provide any feedback. I would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions!

üåü Conclusion
Developing this Snake game has been an incredible journey, and I am excited to share it with the world. This project has helped me improve my skills in React and web development. I look forward to building more projects and continuing to learn and grow as a developer.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
